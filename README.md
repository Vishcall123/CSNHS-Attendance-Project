# CSNHS-Attendance-Project
For Computer Science National Honors Society (NORTHVIEW HIGH SCHOOL)

This project was a basic project aimed to solve the issue at my school of many students becoming tardy due to a paper sheet that was used to sign in/out of the building. This system was inefficient and ineffective, so @ayushpatwari and @reflex8 and I decided to create this application.

This application is to be connected to our school's domain and act as its own server. The "app.py" file is built on Flask while the other files are native HTML and CSS. 

Together, they form a sleek website that has functionality and aesthetics.
